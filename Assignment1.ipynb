What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","Ans: In python,pre-defined keywords are the reserveed words that have a special meaning.\n","The pre-defined keywords are as follows:\n","a)if,else,elif(conditional statements)\n","b)for,while(loop)\n","c)def(function definition)\n","d)class (class definition) and many more.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","Ans:No,keywords cannot be used as variable names in python as keywords are reserved for some specifgic purposes.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","Ans:Mutability in python reffers to the ability of an object to be modified once it is created.Some mutable objects in python are:a)Lists\n","                                                      b)Dictionaries\n","                                                      c)Set\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","Ans:Lists are mutable as it is designed for dynamic data,where elements may need to be added,removed and modified whereas Tuples are immutable as it is designed for static data,where elements are fixed and should not change.\n","\n","7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python/\n","Ans:In python(==) is used for equality check,to check if values of two objects are equal.\n","(is) ,identity operator is used to check if both variables reffers to same object in memory.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","Ans:The logical operator in python is used to compare or to check two or more conditions.The logical operators are:Logical AND\n","                                     Logical OR\n","                                     Logical NOT\n","\n","9.What is type casting in Python?\n","Ans:Type casting in python is a process to convert one data type to another.There are two types of type-casting:a)Implicit Type Casting\n","                                    b)Explicit Type Casting\n","\n","10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","Ans: Implicit Type Casting:Python automatically converts one data type to another. No manual interventions required.\n","Explicit Type Casting:In this we have to manually convert one data type to another type.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","Ans:In python,conditional statements are used to make decisions based upon a specific condition.The statements are:a)If Statement\n","                                      b)Elif Statement\n","                                      c)If-Else Statement\n","                                      d)Nested-If Statement\n","\n","12.How does the elif statement work/\n","Ans:The elif statement in python is used to check additional conditions if the initial If condition in false.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops/\n","Ans:For Loop: It is used to iterate over a sequence.Terminates when all elements are processed.\n","While Loop: It is used for repeating code while a condition is true.Terminates when the condition becomes false.In while initialisation of looping variable and updation is mandatory.\n","\n","14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","Ans:User Input Validation:In this the user is prompted to enter a password and the program needs to keep asking for inputs until a valid password is enterted.Here while loop is more suitable than for loop`.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HAPUcck9tAKI"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"06KYbKg0s9o0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752414619619,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15414,"user":{"displayName":"Arpita Das","userId":"13321481246634228873"}},"outputId":"867d4936-b91f-4e5b-d057-7ddbb6ed703e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n","Nmae: Arpita Das\n","Age: 24\n","['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n","Enter a word: 1\n","'1' is not a python keyword.\n","Enter first number:12\n","Enter second number:4\n","Addition: 12.0 + 4.0 = 16.0\n","Substraction: 12.0 - 4.0 = 8.0\n","Multiplication: 12.0 * 4.0 = 48.0\n","Division: 12.0 / 4.0 = 3.0\n","True\n","True\n","False\n","Enter a number:2\n","Integer: 2\n","Float: 2.0\n","Boolean: True\n","String List: ['1', '2', '3', '4']\n","Integer List: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","Enter a number:8\n","It is a positive number\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","6\n","7\n","8\n","9\n","10\n","Total of even number sum from 1 to 50 is: 650\n","olleh\n"]}],"source":["# Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","# Write a Python program that displays your name and age\n","name = \"Arpita Das\"\n","age = 24\n","\n","print(\"Nmae:\", name)\n","print(\"Age:\", age)\n","\n","# Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n","\n","# Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword\n","import keyword\n","word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","  print(f\"'{word}' is a python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","  print(f\"'{word}' is not a python keyword.\")\n","\n","#.
